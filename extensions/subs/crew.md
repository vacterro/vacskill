# saicrew -- run a 3-agent crew with one command each

**Bonus layer, zero Core changes.** Everything here is the subSaipen
extension (RFC § 1.9) plus a launcher script. No RFC rule, no phase doc, no
`validate.py` field, no schema is touched -- the crew is built entirely from
mechanisms Core already ships. If any line here ever fights Core, Core wins.

The picture the operator asked for: you dig the tunnel (the Core agent),
two workers set the beams and run the wiring behind you (the subSaipens).
You don't remind them. Each one has a task -> does it -> reports. Harmony is
not "the agents are friends" -- it's the contract below.

---

## The three roles (a triangle -- stable, not a crowd)

| Agent | Role | mode | Writes to | Does, on loop |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Core** | the writer -- digs the tunnel | `full` | `.saipen/` + the real code | pick TODO -> BUILD -> VERIFY -> REVIEW -> SHIP -> **collect** -> next |
| **saihunt** | the sensor -- finds bugs | `read-only` | only `subs/saihunt/` | HUNT 6 signals -> write findings to its OUTBOX -> HUNT again |
| **saipython** | the fixer -- clears the tail | `read-only` | only `subs/saipython/pen/` + its OUTBOX | clone target -> fix in pen -> VERIFY -> ready patch in OUTBOX -> next |

Three is the right number: two is a pair (one drops, all stops); five is a
crowd (coordination eats more tokens than work). Three is a triangle -- one
buckles, two carry.

**Only Core writes the main project.** The subSaipens never touch the main
tree (enforced: `mode: read-only`, `tools/validate.py` rejects a sub in
`BUILD`/`SHIP`). Their only door out is `kitchen/OUTBOX.md`; Core pulls
through `saipen sub collect`. That is what keeps the soup from spoiling --
each cook chops on their own board, the sauce is passed through the OUTBOX,
never over the rim of the pot.

## Start the crew (one command per window)

No agent-chat platform today spawns three independent sessions from one
window (Core's own § 1.4: one agent writes `.saipen/` at a time -- by
design). So: **three terminals/windows, but each is one line.**

Fastest -- the launcher (`bootstrap/saipen_crew.bat` on Windows,
`saipen_crew.sh` on Unix): one click opens three windows, each with its
command already typed. Hit Enter in each.

Or by hand, one line per window:

```
window 1 (Core):       saipen continue
window 2 (sensor):     saihunt
window 3 (fixer):      saipython
```

A bare subSaipen name (`saihunt`, `saipython`, `saiwiki`) is a **role-adopt**
command (PROTOCOL.md § 7): the agent spawns that sub if it doesn't exist
yet, becomes it, and starts its loop -- no second command needed. Want it
fully autonomous between tickets? After adopting, it runs
`saipen goal "process my board, verify each, report through OUTBOX"` and
doesn't stop until its wave/ticket valve trips (RFC § 2.4).

That's the whole ask: **type one word -> the agent knows its job -> it works.**

---

## Zones -- draw the boundary on the ticket (a contract, not a promise)

Three cooks salting blind is chemical warfare. The fix is not "agree how much
salt" -- it's a **zone written on the ticket**: this file-glob is yours, that
one isn't. Because zones live inside the ticket **description** (not as new
`|` pipe-fields -- those would need a Core/`validate.py` change), they cost
nothing and break nothing:

```markdown
## TODO
- [ ] T-101 [zone: src/auth/**] Fix auth flow | owner: alpha | claim_time: 2026-07-24T10:00:00Z
- [ ] T-102 [zone: src/ui/**] Settings rework | owner: beta  | claim_time: 2026-07-24T10:00:00Z
- [ ] T-103 [zone: tests/**] Coverage for auth+settings | needs: T-101,T-102 | owner: gamma
```

Checkable, not trust-based: `git diff --name-only` on an agent's work shows
instantly if it left its zone. Overlapping zones aren't two zones -- they're
one, done by one agent, or split by file. Self-signature goes in the
description too, on completion: `[done_by: alpha] [verify: PASS]`, and
delegation as `[delegated_from: T-101] [by: alpha]`. Full audit, zero new
fields, zero Core touch.

---

## The auto-collect gate (Core never leaves the beams lying)

Core, while running as a crew, collects every cycle -- this is crew guidance
to the Core operator, not a change to `phases/ship.md`:

> After each SHIP (and at the top of each `saipen continue`), run
> `saipen sub collect`: read every OUTBOX, `critical: true` -> a `T-###` on
> the main board immediately, `critical: false` -> `_shared/inbox.md`, mark
> the entry `reviewed`, LOG the `collect` line. Only then pick the next
> ticket.

So Core never races ahead of the workers, and the workers never pile an
OUTBOX nobody reads (backpressure: a sub with >10 unreviewed `ready` entries
parks itself `BLOCKED`, PROTOCOL.md § 2).

---

## The ten pitfalls -> the mechanism that already kills each (nothing new)

| Pitfall | Killed by (all pre-existing Core) |
|---|---|
| Amnesia ("what do I do?") | State on disk: STATE -> BOARD -> LOG tail -> execute `next_action` (BOOT.md, TEST-001). Never asks. |
| Two agents grab one ticket | Claim lock + **re-read after write** (RFC § 1.4). Lost the write -> take another ticket, never overwrite. In a crew only Core writes the main board, so this can't even arise there. |
| Zombie ticket (agent crashed) | A `DOING` ticket with a stale/absent claim is adoptable: LOG the takeover, check `kitchen/`, continue (§ 1.4). No "maybe it'll come back". |
| Fake green | VERIFY is mandatory, real harness only; cap 3 dead hypotheses / 2 fix cycles -> `BLOCKED` (verify.md). A fixer with no toolchain marks `unverified`, never fakes `ready` (PROTOCOL.md § 9). |
| Infinite "what else?" | Safety valve: 3 waves / 20 tickets per `goal` run, then stop + report (§ 2.4). ADD is evolution not invention. |
| Dirty tree panic | Dirty tree is NORMAL (commits at SHIP). Attribute before acting; never revert/commit another agent's uncommitted work (§ 1.5). |
| No accounting | LOG append-only, `[agent: <id>]` self-signs each line; checkpoint after every ticket LOG->BOARD->STATE (§ 1.5). |
| Stale patch (base_head moved) | Fixer re-checks HEAD in PREPARE, re-cuts or marks `stale`; Core re-checks `base_head` before `git apply` (PROTOCOL.md § 9). |
| Valve trips mid-run, subs pile up | Valve-sync: when Core hits the valve it `saipen sub pause`s the crew; `saipen goal` (bare) resets counters and `saipen sub resume`s them. |
| Forgot to launch one window | Graceful degradation: `saipen sub list` WARNs on a sub gone quiet; Core just skips it at collect and works with who's alive. Never stops. |

## Honest limits

- One chat is not three agents -- platforms don't spawn parallel sessions
  from one window. The crew is three windows; the launcher just makes each
  a single keystroke.
- No real-time cross-window sync and no auto-apply without Core's gates --
  by design. The OUTBOX + freshness check is the sync; Core's
  VERIFY/REVIEW/SHIP is the gate. That is the safety, not a limitation to
  paper over.

*Three windows burn in the night --*
*each one digs its own stretch,*
*the tunnel is already glowing.*
