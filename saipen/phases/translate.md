# Phase: TRANSLATE (triggered by `saipen translate`)

Deep, isolated translation preparation system. This phase runs in a strictly quarantined environment and focuses exclusively on building a massive translation bundle without touching the main software.

1. **Isolation Rule:**
   - "Exclusively inside `.saipen/saitranslate/`" scopes the *translation work itself* -- the software's source and assets. When the same agent already running the project transitions into this phase (the common case -- phase-switching, not parallelism), it does NOT suspend normal SAIPEN bookkeeping: `.saipen/STATE.md`/`BOARD.md`/`LOG.md` still get checkpointed exactly as every other phase requires (§ 1.5). Isolation and protocol discipline are not in tension.
   - **Legacy root-level `.saitranslate/`** (pre-v7.35.0 projects): recognize it as equivalent, MAY migrate (`git mv .saitranslate .saipen/saitranslate`, one LOG line) at a convenient checkpoint, never maintain both at once. Both present at once is a conflict, not a merge job -- `.saipen/saitranslate/` is authoritative, the root copy is stale, ticket its removal, don't guess which is newer (RFC § 2.1).
   - **Starting a parallel TRANSLATE instance requires the project's `.saipen/` to already exist** (`saipen set` already ran) -- same precondition `saipen sub spawn` requires. No `.saipen/` yet? Tell the user to run `saipen set` first; TRANSLATE is never a substitute for INIT.
   - You MUST NOT touch, modify, or inject code into the main project files during this phase. Treat the main project strictly as a read-only reference to understand what strings need translation.
   - `.saipen/saitranslate/` has its own `kitchen/` for scratch and half-finished work -- separate from `.saipen/kitchen/`, never shared with it. Nothing from this phase's scratch work belongs in the main project's kitchen.
   - **Running as a separate, dedicated agent** (sent to build the translation bundle while the main agent keeps building elsewhere -- true parallelism, not a phase switch): do NOT write `phase: TRANSLATE` into the shared `.saipen/STATE.md` -- that stomps on whatever the main agent's own session actually has active (RFC § 1.4's concurrency boundary: one agent writes `.saipen/` at any instant). Keep progress in `.saipen/saitranslate/STATE.md` instead -- same shape as Core's own `STATE.md` (`phase`/`task`/`next_action`/`agent`/`updated`), scoped to this build, nobody else's business to touch. The only contact with shared files is the completion line step 4 already requires -- append it to the *main* `.saipen/LOG.md` when done, nothing more, nothing during the run. This isn't read-only work (it writes plenty, just confined to `.saipen/saitranslate/`) -- don't confuse it with `.saipen/extensions/subs/`'s subSaipen, which is read-only toward the whole project and never writes anywhere real. TRANSLATE-in-parallel writes freely inside its own sandbox; it just never touches the *shared* bookkeeping mid-run.

2. **Determine the real translation surface -- cover everything real, fabricate nothing:**
   - Read the actual project before deciding what to translate. A project's real translatable surface is **both** of the following when they exist -- not an either/or choice, not "pick whichever" -- TRANSLATE's job is everything translatable in the repo, docs and software together:
     - **(a) Documentation**: `README.md` and other top-level docs a user actually reads.
     - **(b) Real in-app UI strings**, if the software actually has any -- grep the real source for genuine UI-string patterns (an existing i18n/locale file already in use, real button/label text) before building an `app.title`/`action.continue`-style JSON bundle. If nothing like that exists, don't invent it.
   - Most SAIPEN-managed projects (protocols, CLIs, libraries, docs-first tools) have (a) and not (b) -- translate what's real, skip what isn't, never fabricate the missing half to make the bundle look more complete than the project actually is. (A real incident: an earlier run built exactly such a fabricated bundle for this repo -- SAIPEN has no app, no settings screen, no `action.continue` button anywhere -- 32 languages of strings that translated nothing real.)
   - **Docs**: translate what's covered by (a) above that doesn't already have a hand-maintained per-language sibling. Never re-translate or overwrite a file the project already maintains by hand per language (check for an existing `<name>_XX.md`-style file first, e.g. this repo's own `guides/`) -- note it as already covered instead of duplicating or clobbering curated work. **This carve-out is permanent, not just first-build**: § 3's drift re-scan below only watches surfaces TRANSLATE itself builds in `.saipen/saitranslate/kitchen/` -- a hand-maintained sibling was never that, so TRANSLATE never re-syncs it either, on the first run or any later one. Keeping it in step with its English source after the source changes is whoever edits that source's own job (a normal ticket, same as any other doc update) -- never assume it happens automatically just because a `saipen translate` run happened to fire afterward.
   - **UI strings**: where (b) applies, build the JSON-bundle-per-locale system, sourced only from strings that actually exist in the software.
   - Same scope either way: 32 languages, **prioritizing English, Russian, Estonian, and Japanese**, same isolation rule (§ 1), same `.saipen/saitranslate/kitchen/` destination (§ 4) -- this section only changes *what* gets read to produce the bundle, never where it lives or how it gets integrated.
   - The full list is: *English, Russian, Estonian, Japanese, Ukrainian, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Polish, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Norwegian, Chinese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Hindi, Indonesian, Greek, Czech, Romanian, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Slovak, Croatian*.
   - **Flags:** For each language, associate a flag icon -- a language-picker table in a doc (this repo's own `GUIDE.md`/`README.md`) for docs-first projects, live-switching config in Settings for UI-bearing ones. Unicode regional-indicator flag emoji (🇺🇸🇷🇺🇪🇪🇯🇵...) are the universal baseline every agent can produce without an image tool; use drawn/SVG assets only if the platform supports image generation and the project's existing icons are already that style -- match the project, don't invent a new asset pipeline.
   - **Bonus Voice:** You MUST also build a `«Дед»` (angry-grandpa) voice localization.

3. **Maintenance and Update -- keep a running finger on the project's pulse:**
   - Every `saipen translate` run, not just the first, re-scans **both** surfaces from § 2 (docs and real UI strings alike) against what's already built in `.saipen/saitranslate/kitchen/` -- a new doc added, an existing doc edited, a new real UI string introduced since the last run all count as drift the project accumulated while TRANSLATE wasn't watching.
   - Translate and update exactly that drift across all 32 languages + bonus voice. Don't blindly rebuild everything from scratch on every run, and don't silently skip what changed either -- stale translations sitting next to updated source are worse than no translation at all, since nothing signals they've gone wrong.
   - Before calling it done, verify coverage is real, not assumed: spot-check that everything identified in § 2 actually has a matching entry in every locale. A partial pass reported as 100% is a worse outcome than an honest partial report -- if something's missing, say so in the completion LOG line, don't round up.

4. **Completion:**
   - Once the translation bundle is fully built, validated, and up-to-date,
     LOG one normal Event Graph line per RFC § 1.2 -- `- DATE [E-###]
     [parent: E-###] RUN: translate -> done @SHORT-HASH` (this exact text
     after the taxonomy, not a free-text summary) -- then transition the
     phase back to `DONE`.
   - **Parallel dedicated instance (§ 1) only**: on completion, delete your
     own `.saipen/saitranslate/STATE.md` -- it is transient run-state, not
     the persistent bundle. The bundle in `.saipen/saitranslate/kitchen/`
     stays (a future `ADD`/`PLAN` integrates it); the STATE cursor does not,
     and no other phase reaps it, so leaving it strands a stale STATE the
     next `saipen sub list`/scan trips over. A same-agent phase switch never
     wrote a separate one (it uses the main `.saipen/STATE.md`), so this step
     is a no-op there.
   - TRANSLATE completion does NOT integrate the bundle into the main
     software -- the bundle sits safely in `.saipen/saitranslate/kitchen/` until
     a future `ADD`/`PLAN` ticket formally integrates it, through the
     normal `VERIFY`/`REVIEW`/`SHIP` gates like any other change, never as
     a side effect of TRANSLATE itself.
